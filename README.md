## 📁 File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure, styles, and JavaScript logic.

> No additional files are required, as all CSS and JavaScript are embedded within `index.html`.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **💬 Chat System**  
  User inputs are processed by the `sendMessage()` function, which triggers a response after a simulated typing delay (1.5–2.5 seconds). Responses are selected from the `gameResponses` object based on keyword matching (e.g., "RPG," "multiplayer").

- **🕒 Typing Indicator**  
  A visual animation with bouncing dots appears while the AI "thinks."

- **📌 Suggestion Buttons**  
  Predefined buttons trigger specific queries to streamline user interaction.

- **🌠 Particle Animation**  
  50 particles are dynamically generated with random positions, delays, and durations to create a floating effect.

- **📱 Responsive Design**  
  Media queries ensure the layout adapts to smaller screens, with adjustments to font sizes, padding, and input area layout.

---

## 🎨 Customization

- **💬 Game Responses**  
  Modify the `gameResponses` object in the `<script>` section to add or update game recommendations and categories.

- **🖌️ Styling**  
  Adjust the CSS in the `<style>` section to change colors, animations, or layout.

- **🌠 Particles**  
  Tweak the `createParticles()` function to adjust the number, size, or animation properties of the background particles.

- **🔘 Suggestions**  
  Update the suggestion buttons in the HTML to include new queries or modify existing ones.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The application is designed to be **lightweight and standalone**, making it easy to deploy or modify.
- The chat responses are currently based on a **static `gameResponses` object**. For a more dynamic AI experience, integrate with an API like xAI's Grok API (see [xAI API](https://example.com ) for details).
- The design is optimized for **modern browsers** supporting CSS gradients, animations, and backdrop filters.
